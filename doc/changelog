recidivm (0.1.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * In the first step, set virtual memory limit to 32 TiB (slightly above the
    typical usage for 64-bit ASan-ed programs).
    On x86, this should reduce the number of execs by 2 for virtually all
    target programs.
  * Round virtual memory limit to (at least) page size.
    On x86, this could reduce the number of execs by 12 (for “-u B”)
    or by 2 (for “-u K”).
  * Put license into a separate file.

  * Fix GCC 7 compiler warnings.
